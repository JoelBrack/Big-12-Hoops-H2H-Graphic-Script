# Big-12-Hoops-H2H-Graphic-Script
Writing a script to scrape data and create a Big 12 Hoops head to head graphic. This was an exercise I did to learn more about scraping web data using Beautiful Soup and practice my skills with pandas dfs. I posted this to my college sports related twitter account, @WVStatsGuy.

Code and explanation in the Jupyter notebook file.

Cleaned up final version in the .png file.
